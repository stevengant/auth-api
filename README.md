# LAB - Class 08

## Project: auth-api

### Author: Steve Gant

### Problem Domain  

In this final phase, the new requirement is to extend the restrictive capabilities of our routes to our API, implementing a fully functional, authenticated and authorized API Server using the latest coding techniques.

Specifically, we want to make the following restrictions:

  - Regular users can READ.
  - Writers can READ and CREATE.
  - Editors can READ, CREATE, and UPDATE.
  - Administrators can READ, CREATE, UPDATE, and DELETE.

Routes that end up performing those actions in our API/Database need to be protected by both a valid user and that userâ€™s permissions.
